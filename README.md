This repository provides a simple method for copying positions between multiple charts on SierraChart.

The main purpose of this is really to copy trades on multiple accounts. For this you will usually have multiple SierraChart instances running.

Blah blah blah. Do not use this. If you use it, make sure you set your maximum positions just in case things go haywire.
